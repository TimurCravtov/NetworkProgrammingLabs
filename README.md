## Laboratory works on Networking Programming

These laboratory works are focused on learning and applying the knowledge about Networking Programming (covering topics such as sockets, HTTP, TCP/IT). 

All the laboratory works are implemented in `Python`. Inside each laboratory work folder there is a `README.md` file which can be threated as a report of the work done; moreover, each lab has a `docker-compose.yml` file which can generally be used to run the app in container. Additional information is provided in the respective `README.md`
